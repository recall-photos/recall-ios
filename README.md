# Recall iOS üì∏

![Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/recall-photos/recall-app/master/Screenshots.png)

Recall is an open-source and decentralized alternative to Google Photos built on top of Blockstack. Photos are stored encrypted with the user's private key and therefore not accessible to anyone else.

## Features

- Private and free - No one but you has access to your photos
- Simple to use - Login via Blockstack auth and start uploading your photos
- Open source - All our code is open sourced on Github
- No storage lock-in -  Change your storage provider at any time
- ~~Search your photos - You will be able to search your photos by location, time and other data~~
- ~~Share with friends - Share your photos with others, without losing any of the privacy benefits~~
